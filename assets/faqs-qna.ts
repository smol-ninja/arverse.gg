    question: 'Why should you stake?',
    answer:
      'When you stake your AVAX with us, you help secure the network. The more you stake, the more secure it becomes. In return, the network rewards stakers in the form of newly created AVAX tokens.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a validator do?',
    answer:
      'The validator validates transactions and mine new blocks on Avalanche network and its subnets.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much you can stake with us?',
    answer:
      'Minimum: 25 AVAX, Maximum: calculate on the go = 92,700 * 5 - platform.getMaxStakeAmount'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are staking rewards taxable?',
    answer: `Depending on your jurisdiction, staking reward taxation may vary. One approach that some industry groups are lobbying for is that staking rewards should be taxed only at the point when they are liquidated. Another view is that staking rewards should be accounted for when they are earned, which could be as often as every block! Many jurisdictions do not have clear guidelines yet on how staking rewards should be taxed. We are a founding member of the European Blockchain Association’s Proof of Stake Working Group (EUPoS) that seeks to educate European legislators about Proof-of-Stake to foster an innovation-friendly jurisdiction.
    We recommend using services like CoinTracking, or if you are using a tax advisor, working with crypto taxation-focused firms like Pekuna in Germany to ensure you stay compliant while minimizing your tax burden.`
